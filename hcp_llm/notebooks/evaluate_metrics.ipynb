The retrospective analysis included 220 patients with psoriasis who were treated with various biological agents. The results showed that SII and SIRI levels were higher in patients with certain comorbidities and disease characteristics. However, both SII and SIRI significantly decreased after treatment with different biological agents. The study suggests that SII and SIRI could be useful biomarkers for assessing the severity of psoriasis and guiding treatment decisions in patients receiving biological agents.'"
